# Quantum Valet \[in development\]

Quantum Valet is a Python library that automates the process of building training sets for machine learning potentials. Given an initial structure and some iterative task, QV will automatically optimize the structure, and then apply the iterative task (such as moving or replacing atoms) and calculate the relevant features, dramatically increasing efficiency and decreasing the need for human intervention
